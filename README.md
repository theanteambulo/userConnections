Your challenge is to use URLSession to download some JSON from the internet, use Codable to convert it to Swift types, then use NavigationView, List, and more to display it to the user.

- Fetch the data and parse it into User and Friend structs.
- Display a list of users with a little information about them.
- Create a detail view shown when a user is tapped, presenting more information about them.
- If you really want to push your skills, think about how to show each userâ€™s friends on the detail screen.
- For a medium-sized challenge, show a little information about their friends right on the detail screen. For a bigger challenge, make each of those friends tappable to show their own detail view.
